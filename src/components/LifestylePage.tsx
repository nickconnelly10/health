            <span className="font-bold text-burgundy">Morning Wakefulness</span><br />
            Within 10 minutes of waking, expose yourself to natural light—walk outside, eat breakfast on patio, or read by sunny window. Early sun sets circadian clock, boosts alertness and cortisol.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-bold text-burgundy">Nutrition Habits</span><br />
            Refer to Nutrition tab for details. Follow 8-12 hour eating window, focus on whole foods—animal meats, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds—avoid processed products.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-bold text-burgundy">Physical Activity</span><br />
            CDC recommends 150 minutes moderate or 75 minutes vigorous aerobic activity weekly. Build in daily low-intensity movement—walk at dawn or dusk—and aim for one higher-intensity session daily.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-bold text-burgundy">Connection & Purpose</span><br />
            Aim for one meaningful social interaction daily—walk with friend, call family, share meal. These connections boost well-being and promote oxytocin release.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-bold text-burgundy">Focused Work & Breaks</span><br />
            Work in concentrated blocks (50 minutes), then pause to walk, hydrate, stretch, or do push-ups. Regular breaks sustain energy and productivity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-bold text-burgundy">Environmental Detox</span><br />
            Choose non-toxic cleaning and personal-care products, store food in glass or stainless-steel containers. Avoid plastics—use glass water bottles, natural textiles over synthetic fabrics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-bold text-burgundy">Evening Wind-Down</span><br />
            Finish eating 2 hours before bedtime. Dim lights and put away screens 60 minutes before sleep. Unwind with journaling, reading, or gentle stretching.
